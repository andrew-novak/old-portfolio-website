# Personal Website

My own portfolio website with an API and an admin panel.

### How to start it? (Development Mode)

1. Run the bash script:

```
bash ./bashScripts/create-all.sh
```

to create development **.env** and **images/**.

2. Run the npm script in the project root:

```
npm run install-all
```

to install all the **node modules** for:

- project root
- api
- client
- admin

3. Run the npm script:

```
npm run api-client
```

to start the API and the client react website

OR

```
npm run api-admin
```

to start the API and the admin react website.
